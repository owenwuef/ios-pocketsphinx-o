/** EXPERIMENTAL. This will give you N-Best results, most likely at the expense of performance. This can't be used with setReturnSegments: or setReturnSegmentTimes: . This is a wholly experimental feature and can't be used with overly-large language models or on very slow devices. It is the sole responsibility of the developer to test whether performance is acceptable with this feature and to reduce language model size and latencyTuning in order to get a good UX â€“ there is absolutely no guarantee given that this feature will not result in searches which are too slow to return if it has too much to do. If this experimental feature results in an excess of support requests due to too many not reading this warning and consequently reporting realtime n-best slowness of arbitrary models as a bug, it could end up being removed in a future version. */

/** This is the maximum number of nbest results you want to receive. You may receive fewer than this number but will not receive more. This defaults to 3 for RapidEars; larger numbers are likely to use more CPU and smaller numbers less. Settings below 2 are invalid and will be set to 2. It is not recommended to ever set this above 3 for realtime processing. */

/** Setting this to true will cause you to receive your hypotheses as separate words rather than a single NSString. This is a requirement for using OEEventsObserver delegate methods that contain timing or per-word scoring. This can't be used with N-best.*/
- (void) setReturnSegments:(BOOL)returnSegments; 

/** Setting this to true will cause you to receive segment hypotheses with timing attached. This is a requirement for using OEEventsObserver delegate methods that contain word timing information. It only works if you have setReturnSegments set to TRUE. This can't be used with N-best.*/

/** This can take a value between 1 and 4. 4 means the lowest-latency for partial hypotheses and 1 means the highest. The lower the latency, the higher the CPU overhead, and vice versa. This defaults to 4 (the lowest latency and highest CPU overhead) so you will reduce it if you have a need for less CPU overhead until you find the ideal balance between CPU overhead and speed of hypothesis.*/
